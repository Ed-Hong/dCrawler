2D Unity Rogue-Like 


# TODO
1. Enemy OnHit Flash should only occur once at start of Turn
1. Finish Implementing Enemy Movement
1. Implement Enemy Attacks

# Behavioral Bugs


# Visual Bugs
1. Sword animation isn't correctly timed with Turn duration

# Ideas
* Instead of the Player having the WeaponAnimator, what if we made the Weapons class
have its own animator and then make the weapons prefabs?
** You could then give them their own sprites and just draw it ontop of the player, and have it rotate/flip
with the player
